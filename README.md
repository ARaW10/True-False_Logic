Project: True/False Logic

Welcome to my first Arduino Uno project repository! Please note that I am still new to GitHub, so bear with me as I learn the ropes.

Project Overview
This project is titled "True/False Logic", and it showcases basic boolean operations using an Arduino Uno. It's designed for educational purposes and is perfect for beginners who want to learn more about logic gates and boolean operations.

Libraries Used
The project uses two simple and well-known libraries:

Adafruit_GFX: A graphics library that simplifies drawing on displays.  
Adafruit_SSD1306: A library that controls OLED displays, specifically the SSD1306 model.

Purpose of this project is involves working with boolean logic, making it a great educational tool for learning or teaching the fundamentals of logic gates. Feel free to explore, modify, and use it as a foundation for other logic-based projects.
